      <div class="about-me">Hello, my name is Nick - just a little bit about me. I have a wonderful wife of seven and a
        half years that I am lucky to have. We have three beautiful children together. We have been preparing for this
        enormous life change for about 6 months prior to this endeavor, both financially as well as introducing myself
        to code in a self learning environment. I quit my job of 5 years to jump in head first with this journey!</div>
